= Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user or service is allowed to perform a given action within a project. You can define mesh-, namespace-, and workload-wide access control for your workloads in the mesh. 

To configure RBAC, create an `AuthorizationPolicy` custom resource in the namespace for which you are configuring access. If you are configuring mesh-wide access, use `istio-system`. The namespace must match your `metadata.namespace` field.

An authorization policy includes a selector, an action, and a list of rules:

* The `selector` field specifies the target of the policy.
* The `action` field specifies whether to allow or deny the request.
* The `rules` specify when to trigger the action.
** The `from` field in the rules specifies the sources of the request.
** The `to` field in the rules specifies the operations of the request.
** The `when` field specifies the conditions needed to apply the rule.

== Create a role for intra-project communication

== Create a role for the ingress gateway

== Set restricted access

You can deny requests from any source that is not in the `bookinfo` namespace with the following `AuthorizationPolicy` custom resource example.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:

== Creating allow-all and default deny-all authorization policies

The following example shows an allow-all authorization policy that allows full access to all workloads in the default namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all
  namespace: bookinfo
spec:
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - {}
----

The following example shows a policy that doesnâ€™t allow any access to all workloads in the admin namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: admin
spec:
  {}
----

== Authorizing based on identity

The following example shows how to allow only authenticated users to access a workflow.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
 name: httpbin
 namespace: bookinfo
spec:
 selector:
   matchLabels:
     app: httpbin
     version: v1
 action: ALLOW
 rules:
 - from:
   - source:
       principals: ["*"]
   to:
   - operation:
       methods: ["GET", "POST"]

Run the following command once you have written your custom resource to add your custom resource to your namespace. The namespace must match your `metadata.namespace` field.

$ oc create -n <namespace> -f <path_to_yaml_file>
